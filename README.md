# Moonlight Solar Analysis

## Project Overview

Moonlight Solar Analysis is a data analysis project undertaken as part of the 10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery Week 0 Challenge from December 6th to December 8th, 2024. The objective is to analyze solar radiation measurement data to enhance the operational efficiency and sustainability of MoonLight Energy Solutions through targeted solar investments. The analysis involves identifying high-potential regions for solar installation based on environmental measurements.

Key Components:

1. Challenge Overview: Focus on exploring and analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to evaluate candidates for a 12-week training program.
2. Business Objective: Develop a strategic report based on the analysis, recommending high-potential regions for solar installation
3. Dataset Overview: Includes solar radiation, temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and direction data
4. Week's Topics Covered: Python programming, GitHub commands, data understanding and exploration, CI/CD, and dashboard development using Streamlit
5. Deliverables: Git and GitHub setup, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and a Streamlit dashboard.

This project is a comprehensive exercise in data engineering, financial analytics, and machine learning engineering, aimed at preparing participants for real-world job positions.
